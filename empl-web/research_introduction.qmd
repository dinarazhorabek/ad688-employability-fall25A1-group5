Hiring women into top leadership roles, like CEOs or board members, can change the way organizations talk about women [@Lawson2022hiring]. By analyzing over 43,000 company documents with advanced language tools, the researchers found that when women are appointed to senior positions, the language used by those organizations starts to describe women with more leadership-related traits such as confidence and decisiveness. Importantly, this shift doesn’t reduce how often women are described as kind or caring—it simply expands how they are portrayed. In other words, bringing women into leadership helps reshape how society links “being a woman” with “being a leader.”

The research is based on the idea that women’s underrepresentation in leadership comes partly from language and stereotypes that associate men with power and women with warmth. Previous solutions like diversity training often have short-term results. This study suggests that a more lasting change can happen through representation itself: when women hold visible positions of power, they naturally help transform the language, attitudes, and stereotypes that have limited them in the first place.

Although gender representation in leadership has improved in recent decades, perceptions of authority often remain unequal. Research consistently shows that women and men can perform equally well as leaders, yet they are judged differently because of deeply rooted social expectations. [@Eagly2002role]'s role congruity theory suggests that society continues to associate effective leadership with traits that are traditionally viewed as masculine, such as assertiveness, decisiveness, and authority. As a result, when women display these same qualities, they are often perceived as competent but less likable or overly dominant. A recent experiment published in [@Frontiers2023legitimacy] also found that identical leadership decisions were rated as more legitimate when made by men than by women, even after controlling for all other variables. Taken together, these findings highlight a subtle yet persistent perception gap in which authority remains unconsciously linked to gendered expectations. This perception gap helps explain why women, despite achieving comparable results, still encounter skepticism and resistance in positions of power.

This bias is not confined to the workplace but extends into politics and global governance. In 2025, Japan elected Sanae Takaichi as its first female prime minister, marking a historic moment for a country that has long struggled with gender equality in leadership. As reported by [@Time2025takaichi], public and media reactions reflected both celebration and hesitation, combining admiration for this milestone with ongoing scrutiny of her leadership style and decision-making approach. Commentators frequently described her potential leadership through gendered narratives, questioning whether she would govern with “feminine sensitivity” or “masculine toughness,” expressions rarely used to evaluate male leaders. This reaction illustrates how even moments of progress can be accompanied by persistent stereotypes that frame women’s authority through outdated cultural norms. Ultimately, addressing this issue requires more than improving access to leadership opportunities; it calls for a broader cultural shift in how societies define and value leadership, recognizing competence, vision, and authority as qualities that transcend gender.
