# Overview

This website presents a structured analysis of the 2024 U.S. job market using a combination of **Lightcast job postings**, **FRED macroeconomic indicators**, and insights from academic research. Our goal is to understand how economic conditions, skill demand, and organizational behavior shape opportunities for job seekers entering the market in 2024.

The analysis integrates quantitative data (job postings, salaries, geographic distribution, required skills) with qualitative insights drawn from peer-reviewed literature on hiring dynamics, gender disparities, and political context. By combining these perspectives, we aim to provide a more holistic and actionable understanding of labor market patterns.

# Data Sources

Our project leverages two primary sources:

### **1. Lightcast Job Postings (2024)**
This dataset contains thousands of job postings across the United States, including:
- job titles  
- employer information  
- required skills  
- salaries where reported  
- geographic location  
- posting dates  

After cleaning and standardization, this dataset forms the backbone of our empirical analysis. It enables us to explore trends in demand, wage patterns, and regional differences.

### **2. FRED Macroeconomic Indicators**
To contextualize shifts in hiring, we incorporate:
- unemployment rates  
- labor force participation  
- CPI and inflation metrics  
- sector-level economic activity  

These indicators help explain why specific industries expand or contract in hiring over time.

# Motivation

Understanding the job market has become increasingly complicated for recent graduates and career-switchers. Economic volatility, rapid technological change, and evolving skill requirements mean that job seekers must navigate a landscape that shifts year to year.

Three questions guided our analysis:

1. **What skills are most in demand in 2024, and how have they changed over time?**  
2. **How do geographic and sectoral variations influence job opportunities and salaries?**  
3. **How do broader social factors such as gender representation and organizational culture shape hiring outcomes?**

These questions connect quantitative job-posting analysis with deeper research on disparities and structural influences in hiring.
