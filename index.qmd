# Overview

This website presents a structured analysis of the 2024 U.S. job market using a combination of **Lightcast job postings**, **FRED macroeconomic indicators**, and insights from academic research. Our goal is to understand how economic conditions, skill demand, and organizational behavior shape opportunities for job seekers entering the market in 2024.

The analysis integrates quantitative data (job postings, salaries, geographic distribution, required skills) with qualitative insights drawn from peer-reviewed literature on hiring dynamics, gender disparities, and political context. By combining these perspectives, we provide a more holistic and actionable understanding of labor-market patterns.

# Data Sources

Our project leverages two primary sources:

**Lightcast Job Postings (2024)**

This dataset includes thousands of job postings across the United States, containing information on:

- job titles  
- employer details  
- required skills  
- salaries where reported  
- geographic location  
- posting dates  

After cleaning and standardization, this dataset serves as the backbone of our empirical analysis, allowing exploration of hiring demand, wage patterns, and regional variations.

**FRED Macroeconomic Indicators**

To contextualize shifts in hiring, we incorporate macroeconomic time series from the Federal Reserve, including:

- unemployment rates  
- labor-force participation  
- CPI and inflation measures  
- sector-level economic activity  

These indicators help clarify why specific industries expand or contract over time.

# Why It Matters

Navigating the job market has become increasingly complex for recent graduates and career-switchers. Economic uncertainty, rapid technological development, and evolving skill requirements mean that job seekers must adapt to conditions that shift year to year.

Three guiding questions shape our analysis:

1. **Which skills are most in demand in 2024, and how have they evolved?**  
2. **How do geographic and sectoral differences influence job opportunities and salary outcomes?**  
3. **How do broader social factors, such as gender representation and organizational culture affect hiring?**

These questions connect quantitative job-posting data with research on labor inequality, organizational behavior, and workforce development.
