# Gender Disparities in Hiring & Political Influence  
### A 2024 Job Market Analysis by Team 5

## Why This Research Matters

Gender inequality in hiring does not occur uniformly.  
It varies by:

- 🎯 **Industry** (STEM vs. non-STEM)  
- 🗺️ **Region** (liberal vs. conservative states)  
- 🧭 **Policies** (family leave, equal pay laws)  
- 💼 **Role seniority** (representation drops at higher levels)

Our goal is to translate these patterns into **practical insights for job seekers**.
