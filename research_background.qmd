The following section provides a research-based overview of gender disparities in hiring and leadership across academic, organizational, and political contexts. These insights serve as the conceptual foundation for our broader job-market analysis, helping us connect large-scale labor trends with the social and structural dynamics that influence real hiring outcomes. Without altering the original findings, this introduction contextualizes why an understanding of gendered patterns remains crucial for interpreting hiring behaviors and market inequalities in 2024.

<!-- Gender disparity in academic positions and STEM discipline -->
Gender disparities go beyond who holds positions of power, raising deeper questions about the value and compensation assigned to women’s work. In academic STEM disciplines, these pay inequalities occur alongside ongoing underrepresentation, which becomes more pronounced at senior levels. According to the research conducted by [@Galvin2024plosone], of over 20,000 faculty positions across 127 universities revealed that while women constitute approximately 50% of assistant professors in STEM fields, their representation declines significantly to 45.4% at the associate level and just 32.8% among full professors. Geographic variations are noticeable: though the Pacific and East North Central regions show the highest levels of gender representation, yet women in these areas account for only about 25% of tenure-track positions. Whereas mountain region showed visibly lower levels at just 19%. These regional differences seem to reflect the influence of state-level policies such as equal pay laws and paid family leave, as well as local cultural norms and institutional support systems.

These inequality patterns closely tied to the “leaky pipeline” effect, whereas women are more likely to leave STEM careers over time as barriers and disadvantages accumulate throughout their career path. When women are hired into STEM positions, they often receive smaller initial packages than male colleagues, placing them at an immediate disadvantage in launching their researches. Once employed, women often take on a heavier load of mentoring and service work without extra pay, tedious and repetitive tasks that are frequently overlooked in tenure evaluations. This imbalance may persist because women are often viewed as “caretakers,” while men are seen as more “task-driven.” Particularly, states with stronger equal pay laws and better comprehensive family-leave policies, including California, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Washington, illustrate smaller gaps in both representation and compensation. Understanding how wage disparities intersect with structural barriers and cultural perceptions is essential for addressing why qualified women continue to face obstacles in attaining leadership roles and receive recognition that matches their contributions.

Hiring women into top leadership roles, like CEOs or board members, can change the way organizations talk about women [@Lawson2022hiring]. By analyzing over 43,000 company documents with advanced language tools, the researchers found that when women are appointed to senior positions, the language used by those organizations starts to describe women with more leadership-related traits such as confidence and decisiveness. Importantly, this shift doesn’t reduce how often women are described as kind or caring—it simply expands how they are portrayed. In other words, bringing women into leadership helps reshape how society links “being a woman” with “being a leader.”

The research is based on the idea that women’s underrepresentation in leadership comes partly from language and stereotypes that associate men with power and women with warmth. Previous solutions like diversity training often have short-term results. This study suggests that a more lasting change can happen through representation itself: when women hold visible positions of power, they naturally help transform the language, attitudes, and stereotypes that have limited them in the first place.

<!-- Specific case / Woman prime minister in Japan -->
Although gender representation in leadership has improved in recent decades, perceptions of authority often remain unequal. Research consistently shows that women and men can perform equally well as leaders, yet they are judged differently because of deeply rooted social expectations. [@Eagly2002role]'s role congruity theory suggests that society continues to associate effective leadership with traits that are traditionally viewed as masculine, such as assertiveness, decisiveness, and authority. As a result, when women display these same qualities, they are often perceived as competent but less likable or overly dominant. A recent experiment published in [@Frontiers2023legitimacy] also found that identical leadership decisions were rated as more legitimate when made by men than by women, even after controlling for all other variables. Taken together, these findings highlight a subtle yet persistent perception gap in which authority remains unconsciously linked to gendered expectations. This perception gap helps explain why women, despite achieving comparable results, still encounter skepticism and resistance in positions of power.

This bias is not confined to the workplace but extends into politics and global governance. In 2025, Japan elected Sanae Takaichi as its first female prime minister, marking a historic moment for a country that has long struggled with gender equality in leadership. As reported by [@Time2025takaichi], public and media reactions reflected both celebration and hesitation, combining admiration for this milestone with ongoing scrutiny of her leadership style and decision-making approach. Commentators frequently described her potential leadership through gendered narratives, questioning whether she would govern with “feminine sensitivity” or “masculine toughness,” expressions rarely used to evaluate male leaders. This reaction illustrates how even moments of progress can be accompanied by persistent stereotypes that frame women’s authority through outdated cultural norms. Ultimately, addressing this issue requires more than improving access to leadership opportunities; it calls for a broader cultural shift in how societies define and value leadership, recognizing competence, vision, and authority as qualities that transcend gender.

Together, these three perspectives highlight how gender disparities emerge and persist across multiple domains of public life. They demonstrate that inequality is reinforced not only by structural and economic barriers but also by cultural narratives and expectations that shape how leaders are perceived. This research background provides the conceptual framing that informs our later analysis of job-market data, helping us connect macro-level labor trends with the deeper social patterns that influence hiring, advancement, and representation in 2024.
