## Overview
This analysis examines how industry-level gender dominance relates to advertised salaries across job postings. To incorporate this factor into our models, we assigned each NAICS 2-digit industry code to one of three gender representation categories based on U.S. labor statistics:

- **Male-dominated**  
- **Mixed**  
- **Female-dominated**

These categories reflect broad workforce participation trends across major sectors. Male-dominated sectors typically include labor-intensive industries such as construction and transportation, while female-dominated sectors include health care, education, and administrative or professional services. Mixed sectors show more balanced gender representation or significant role-based variation.

The table below summarizes gender dominance patterns across common U.S. business sectors:

### Gender Dominance by Sector

| Sector | Gender Dominance | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting | Male-dominated | Women represent ~42% |
| Mining | Male-dominated | Very low female representation (~15%) |
| Utilities | Male-dominated | Technical roles skew male |
| Construction | Strongly male-dominated | Only ~1.3% of workers are women |
| Manufacturing | Male-dominated | Women ~6.6% |
| Wholesale Trade | Male-dominated | Logistics and sales skew male |
| Retail Trade | Mixed | Admin roles female; logistics roles male |
| Transportation & Warehousing | Male-dominated | Trucking heavily male |
| Information | Mixed | Tech skew male; media more balanced |
| Finance & Insurance | Female-dominated | Women ~61% of workforce |
| Real Estate & Rental & Leasing | Female-dominated | Administrative roles female-majority |
| Professional, Scientific & Technical Services | Female-dominated | High female representation in legal/accounting/consulting |
| Management of Companies & Enterprises | Mixed | Women underrepresented in top roles |
| Administrative & Support Services | Mixed | Admin roles female; waste management male |
| Educational Services | Strongly female-dominated | Women ~70–75% |
| Health Care & Social Assistance | Strongly female-dominated | Women ~80% |
| Arts, Entertainment & Recreation | Mixed | Varies by occupation |
| Accommodation & Food Services | Female-dominated | Service and hospitality roles female-majority |
| Other Services | Female-dominated | Personal care + nonprofit work |
| Public Administration | Mixed | Balanced participation across roles |

### Integration into Modeling

For predictive modeling, we collapsed these nuanced categories into a simplified three-group system:

- **Male-dominated**  
- **Mixed**  
- **Female-dominated**

These were then encoded numerically as:

- `0` → Male-dominated  
- `1` → Mixed  
- `2` → Female-dominated  

This encoding allows the gender composition of industries to be used directly as a structured feature inside regression and machine learning models.

By examining salary differences across these groups—while controlling for experience requirements, employment type, remote status, staffing-company involvement, and geographic factors—we evaluate whether certain industry gender compositions correspond to systematically higher or lower advertised wages within the professional and technical job postings present in our dataset.
```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

lightcast_jp = pd.read_csv("data/lightcast_cleaned.csv",low_memory=False)

naics_gender_map = {
    11: "Male-dominated", 21: "Male-dominated", 22: "Male-dominated", 23: "Male-dominated", 31: "Male-dominated", 42: "Male-dominated", 44: "Mixed", 48: "Male-dominated", 51: "Mixed", 52: "Female-dominated", 53: "Female-dominated", 54: "Female-dominated", 55: "Mixed", 56: "Mixed", 61: "Female-dominated", 62: "Female-dominated", 71: "Mixed", 72: "Female-dominated", 81: "Female-dominated", 92: "Mixed", 99: "Mixed",
}
gender_encoding = {
    "Male-dominated": 0,
    "Mixed": 1,
    "Female-dominated": 2,
}
```

```{python}
lightcast_jp["GENDER_DOMINANCE"] = lightcast_jp["NAICS_2022_2"].map(naics_gender_map).map(gender_encoding)

## Linear Regression
The goal of this model is to answer the question: 

> How does the gender dominance of an industry affect the offered salary in job postings?

We trained a linear regression model using the following features:

- Gender dominance
- Years of Experience
- Employment type
- Remote type
- Internship indicator
- Staffing company indicator
- State
- NAICS code
  
```{python}
features = ["SALARY", "GENDER_DOMINANCE", "MIN_YEARS_EXPERIENCE", "EMPLOYMENT_TYPE", "REMOTE_TYPE", "IS_INTERNSHIP", "COMPANY_IS_STAFFING", "STATE_NAME", "NAICS_2022_2"]

lightcast_jp[features].isna().sum()

median_salary = lightcast_jp["SALARY"].median()
lightcast_jp = lightcast_jp.fillna({
  "SALARY": median_salary
})

df_model = lightcast_jp[features]
# df_model.isna().sum()

df_model = pd.get_dummies(
    df_model,
    columns=["IS_INTERNSHIP", "COMPANY_IS_STAFFING", "STATE_NAME"],
    drop_first=True
)
```
After preparing the dataset and encoding categorical features, we trained a linear regression model using an 80/20 train–test split.    
The coefficient for GENDER_DOMINANCE represents the expected change in salary when moving from one dominance group to the next (male → mixed → female).

### Model Training
```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

X = df_model.drop("SALARY", axis=1)
y = df_model["SALARY"]

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=79)

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

coef = model.coef_[ list(X.columns).index("GENDER_DOMINANCE") ]
print("Salary change per category step:", coef)
```
Moving from a male-dominated to a mixed industry is associated with an average salary increase of about $2,149.     
Moving from mixed to female-dominated shows an additional increase of roughly the same magnitude.

### Predicted Salary by Dominance Group

Using the average job posting profile in our dataset, we generated predicted salaries for each gender dominance category. The results show a **gradual upward trend in salary as industries become more female-dominated**, even after controlling for experience, employment type, remote status, staffing firm involvement, and state-level differences. In other words, postings in female-dominated or mixed industries tend to offer slightly higher advertised salaries than those in male-dominated sectors.

However, it is important to interpret this finding in the context of **the composition of our dataset**. The Lightcast sample is heavily concentrated in knowledge-based and technical occupations, including:

- Data analysts  
- Data scientists  
- Enterprise and solutions architects  
- Business intelligence roles  
- Technical consulting and professional services  

These roles primarily fall within industries such as:

- **Professional, Scientific & Technical Services** (female-leaning to mixed)  
- **Finance & Insurance** (female-dominated)  
- **Information** (mixed)  
- **Management of Companies & Enterprises** (mixed)

Because our dataset contains **few postings from traditionally male-dominated sectors** (e.g., construction, mining, manufacturing, transportation), the model does not capture the broader national labor-market differences across all industries.

Therefore, the upward salary trend toward female-dominated industries should be interpreted as:

> **a pattern specific to the white-collar and analytical job clusters represented in our dataset**, rather than a universal trend across the U.S. economy.

This contextualization helps avoid overgeneralizing findings beyond the scope of the available data.
```{python}
base = X_train.mean().copy()

pred = {}
for group_code in [0, 1, 2]:
    base["GENDER_DOMINANCE"] = group_code
    pred[group_code] = model.predict(base.to_frame().T)[0]

merged = pd.DataFrame({
    "GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE": list(pred.keys()),
    "PREDICTED_SALARY": list(pred.values())
})
merged["GENDER_DOMINANCE"] = merged["GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE"].map({v: k for k, v in gender_encoding.items()})    
merged = merged[["GENDER_DOMINANCE", "GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE", "PREDICTED_SALARY"]]
print(merged)
```
