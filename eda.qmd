### EDA Overview

This page explores hiring trends, salary patterns, geographic variation, remote work availability, and software skill demands using the **cleaned Lightcast dataset** produced earlier.

Each visualization is selected to answer job seeker–focused questions:

- **Which industries are hiring the most?**  
- **How do salaries vary across sectors?**  
- **How common are remote roles?**  
- **How has demand changed over time?**  
- **Which software skills are most requested?**

</div>

### Job Postings by Industry (Top Sectors Hiring)

```{python}
industry_candidates = ["NAICS_2022_2_NAME", "INDUSTRY_NAME", "NAICS_2022_3_NAME"]
industry_col = next((c for c in industry_candidates if c in df.columns), None)
industry_col
```

```{python}
if industry_col:
    industry_counts = (
        df[industry_col]
        .value_counts()
        .head(15)
        .reset_index()
    )
    industry_counts.columns = ["Industry", "Postings"]

    fig = px.bar(
        industry_counts,
        x="Postings",
        y="Industry",
        orientation="h",
        title=f"Top 15 Industries by Job Postings ({industry_col})",
        color="Industry",  # categorical color per industry
        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Prism,  
        height=700
    )

    fig.update_layout(
        yaxis={"categoryorder": "total ascending"},
        plot_bgcolor="white",
        paper_bgcolor="white",
        showlegend=False 
    )

    fig.show()

else:
    print("No industry column found.")
```


**Insight:**  
Professional, Scientific & Technical Services and Administrative & Support Services account for the largest share of job postings, indicating sustained demand for analytical, operational, and client-facing roles. These sectors typically exhibit continuous hiring cycles driven by project-based work, business expansion, and comparatively high turnover. For job seekers, they represent strong entry points into the labor market with broad role variety and relatively frequent openings.

### Salary Distribution by Industry

Salary variation across industries answers: “Which sectors pay more, and how unequal are wages within each industry?”
We use the annualized salary field (ANNUAL_SALARY), which consolidates raw salary data from SALARY_FROM, SALARY_TO, and SALARY and converts it into a consistent yearly format based on reported pay period.
This provides a clean, comparable measure of compensation across all industries.


```{python}
industry_col = industry_col
salary_col = "ANNUAL_SALARY" if "ANNUAL_SALARY" in df.columns else None

if industry_col and salary_col:

    # Filter valid salaries
    df_salary = df[[industry_col, salary_col]].dropna()

    # Remove noise categories that distort analysis
    df_salary = df_salary[df_salary[industry_col] != "Unclassified Industry"]

    # Cap extreme values at 300k for readability (still accurate for 95% of postings)
    df_salary[salary_col] = np.where(df_salary[salary_col] > 300000, 300000, df_salary[salary_col])

    # Compute median salary per industry for ordering
    medians = (
        df_salary.groupby(industry_col)[salary_col]
        .median()
        .sort_values(ascending=True)
    )

    ordered_categories = medians.index.tolist()

    fig = px.box(
        df_salary,
        y=industry_col,
        x=salary_col,
        category_orders={industry_col: ordered_categories},
        title="Annual Salary Distribution by Industry (Capped at 300K for Readability)",
        color=industry_col,
        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Vivid,
        height=900
    )

    fig.update_layout(
        showlegend=False,
        xaxis_title="Annual Salary (USD)",
        yaxis_title="Industry",
        margin=dict(l=120)
    )

    fig.show()

else:
    print("Salary chart not generated: Missing industry or salary column.")
```

**Insight:**  
Annual salary levels differ substantially across industries, with Finance, Information, and Professional Services exhibiting the highest median compensation. The wide dispersion of salaries within these sectors reflects variation in seniority, specialization, and credential requirements. In contrast, service-oriented industries such as Retail and Accommodation & Food Services show lower but more compressed salary ranges, consistent with narrower variation in role complexity. These patterns suggest that targeted upskilling toward high-skill roles in Finance, Tech, and Professional Services is likely to yield the greatest earnings uplift.

### Remote vs. On-Site Job Patterns

Remote work availability is a crucial factor for job seekers.  
This chart shows whether industries lean toward remote, hybrid, or in-person work.
Here, [None] represents postings where Lightcast did not provide a remote-work tag, which typically corresponds to on-site or unspecified arrangements.

```{python}
remote_candidates = ["REMOTE_TYPE_NAME", "REMOTE_TYPE"]
remote_col = next((c for c in remote_candidates if c in df.columns), None)
```

```{python}
if remote_col:
    remote_counts = df[remote_col].value_counts().reset_index()
    remote_counts.columns = ["Work Arrangement", "Postings"]

    fig = px.pie(
        remote_counts,
        names="Work Arrangement",
        values="Postings",
        title="Remote vs On-Site Job Postings",
        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel1
    )
    fig.show()
else:
    print("No remote work field found.")
```

**Insight:**  
The majority of postings either do not explicitly tag remote work or are implicitly on-site, with only a modest share labeled as Remote or Hybrid. Where remote options are available, they are concentrated in data, IT, and knowledge-intensive roles that can be performed digitally. For job seekers prioritizing location flexibility, this suggests focusing on analytically oriented roles and employers that have formal remote-work policies rather than assuming remote options are widespread across all occupations.

### Job Postings Over Time

Seasonal and macroeconomic patterns show up in how postings evolve over time.
We aggregate job postings by month using the standardized POSTED date.

```{python}
if "POSTED" in df.columns:
    df["POSTED"] = pd.to_datetime(df["POSTED"], errors="coerce")

    monthly = (
        df.groupby(df["POSTED"].dt.to_period("M"))
        .size()
        .reset_index(name="Postings")
    )
    monthly["Month"] = monthly["POSTED"].astype(str)
else:
    monthly = pd.DataFrame()

if not monthly.empty:
    fig = px.line(
        monthly,
        x="Month",
        y="Postings",
        title="Monthly Job Posting Trends (2024)",
        markers=True,
        color_discrete_sequence=["#34495E"],
        height=500
    )
    fig.update_traces(line_width=3)
    fig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=45)
    fig.show()
else:
    print("No valid POSTED data to plot monthly trend.")
```

**Insight:**  
Posting volumes exhibit a clear mid-year trough in late June followed by a strong rebound in July and August, consistent with typical fiscal and academic hiring cycles. The June slowdown likely reflects decision lags around mid-year budgets, while the late-summer increase aligns with pre-fall staffing needs. For job seekers, this timing suggests that applications submitted immediately after the June dip are more likely to coincide with rising employer demand.

### Geographic Distribution of Jobs (by State)

Geographic EDA answers: “Which states have the most job opportunities?”
We use STATE_NAME (cleaned) to compute the total number of postings per state.

```{python}
if "STATE_NAME" in df.columns:
    state_counts = df["STATE_NAME"].value_counts().head(25).reset_index()
    state_counts.columns = ["State", "Postings"]

    fig = px.bar(
        state_counts,
        x="Postings",
        y="State",
        orientation="h",
        title="Top 25 States by Job Postings",
        color="Postings",
        color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Teal,
        height=700
    )
    fig.update_layout(yaxis={'categoryorder':'total ascending'})
    fig.show()
else:
    print("STATE_NAME field not found.")
```

**Insight:**  
Texas, California, and Florida emerge as national hiring hubs, reflecting their large and diversified economies, population growth, and strong business ecosystems. Many of the remaining top states, such as Virginia, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina are anchored by federal agencies, financial centers, or technology clusters. Concentrating job search efforts in these high-volume states can materially increase the number of suitable opportunities available to candidates.

### Top Software Skills in Job Postings

To support the Skill Gap Analysis page, we identify which software tools are requested most often.
This uses the cleaned SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME column produced in the Data Cleaning step.

```{python}
if "SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME" in df.columns:
    skills = (
        df["SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME"]
        .astype(str)
        .str.split(",")
        .explode()
        .str.strip()
    )
    skills = skills[(skills != "") & (skills != "nan")]

    top_skills = skills.value_counts().head(15).reset_index()
    top_skills.columns = ["Skill", "Postings"]

    fig = px.bar(
        top_skills,
        x="Postings",
        y="Skill",
        orientation="h",
        title="Top 15 Software Skills Requested",
        color="Postings",
        color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.OrRd,
        height=600
    )
    fig.update_layout(yaxis={'categoryorder':'total ascending'})
    fig.show()
else:
    print("Software skills column not available.")
```

**Insight:**
SQL, Python, and Excel appear as the most universally requested tools, underscoring their status as core competencies for analytics, BI, and operations roles. Tableau and Power BI, together with dashboarding skills more broadly, highlight the premium placed on communicating data insights visually. Cloud and platform skills such as AWS, Azure, and Oracle Cloud are less frequent but still prominent, indicating growing demand for candidates who can work across both traditional analytics stacks and modern cloud-based architectures.

### EDA Summary

The exploratory analysis reveals five consistent themes in the 2024 job market:
	•	Industry concentration: Hiring is heavily concentrated in Professional Services, Administrative & Support Services, and key service sectors, which together generate a large share of postings.
	•	Compensation differences: Median annual salaries vary sharply by industry, with Finance, Information, and Professional Services offering the strongest earnings potential.
	•	Remote work structure: Explicitly remote and hybrid roles remain a minority but are disproportionately found in digital and analytics-intensive occupations.
	•	Seasonality: Job posting activity dips around late June and rebounds sharply in late summer, highlighting the importance of timing in job search strategies.
	•	Skill demand: SQL, Python, Excel, BI tools, and cloud platforms dominate technical requirements, defining a clear “baseline stack” for aspiring data and business analytics professionals.

These insights directly feed into the subsequent Skill Gap Analysis, ML Methods, and Career Strategy sections by identifying which industries, skills, and time windows matter most for job seekers in 2024.
