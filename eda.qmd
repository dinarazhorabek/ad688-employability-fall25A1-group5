### EDA Overview

This page explores hiring trends, salary patterns, geographic variation, remote work availability, and software skill demands using the **cleaned Lightcast dataset** produced earlier.

Each visualization is selected to answer job seeker–focused questions:

- **Which industries are hiring the most?**  
- **How do salaries vary across sectors?**  
- **How common are remote roles?**  
- **How has demand changed over time?**  
- **Which software skills are most requested?**

</div>

### Job Postings by Industry (Top Sectors Hiring)

```{python}
industry_candidates = ["NAICS_2022_2_NAME", "INDUSTRY_NAME", "NAICS_2022_3_NAME"]
industry_col = next((c for c in industry_candidates if c in df.columns), None)
industry_col
```

```{python}
if industry_col:
    industry_counts = (
        df[industry_col]
        .value_counts()
        .head(15)
        .reset_index()
    )
    industry_counts.columns = ["Industry", "Postings"]

    fig = px.bar(
        industry_counts,
        x="Postings",
        y="Industry",
        orientation="h",
        title=f"Top 15 Industries by Job Postings ({industry_col})",
        color="Postings",
        color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Blues,
        height=650
    )
    fig.update_layout(yaxis={'categoryorder':'total ascending'})
    fig.show()
else:
    print("No industry column found.")
```


**Insight:**  
Professional, Scientific & Technical Services and Administrative & Support Services dominate hiring, indicating strong demand for analytical, operational, and business-support roles.
Industries with the highest posting counts typically experience continuous hiring cycles due to ongoing service needs, expansion, and higher turnover.
This pattern signals promising entry points for job seekers aiming for rapid placement or diverse role availability.

### Salary Distribution by Industry

Salary variation across industries answers: “Which sectors pay more, and how unequal are wages within each industry?”
We use the annualized salary field (ANNUAL_SALARY), which consolidates raw salary data from SALARY_FROM, SALARY_TO, and SALARY and converts it into a consistent yearly format based on reported pay period.
This provides a clean, comparable measure of compensation across all industries.


```{python}
industry_col = industry_col
salary_col = "ANNUAL_SALARY" if "ANNUAL_SALARY" in df.columns else None

if industry_col and salary_col:

    # Filter valid salaries
    df_salary = df[[industry_col, salary_col]].dropna()

    # Remove noise categories that distort analysis
    df_salary = df_salary[df_salary[industry_col] != "Unclassified Industry"]

    # Cap extreme values at 300k for readability (still accurate for 95% of postings)
    df_salary[salary_col] = np.where(df_salary[salary_col] > 300000, 300000, df_salary[salary_col])

    # Compute median salary per industry for ordering
    medians = (
        df_salary.groupby(industry_col)[salary_col]
        .median()
        .sort_values(ascending=True)
    )

    ordered_categories = medians.index.tolist()

    fig = px.box(
        df_salary,
        y=industry_col,
        x=salary_col,
        category_orders={industry_col: ordered_categories},
        title="Annual Salary Distribution by Industry (Capped at 300K for Readability)",
        color=industry_col,
        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Vivid,
        height=900
    )

    fig.update_layout(
        showlegend=False,
        xaxis_title="Annual Salary (USD)",
        yaxis_title="Industry",
        margin=dict(l=120)
    )

    fig.show()

else:
    print("Salary chart not generated: Missing industry or salary column.")
```

**Insight:**  
Industries show substantial variation in annual salary levels, with Finance, Technology, and Healthcare ranking among the highest median-paying sectors.
The wide spread of salary values within these sectors reflects diverse role seniority, specialization requirements, and certification-driven compensation structures.
Meanwhile, service-oriented sectors such as Retail, Accommodation, and Food Services exhibit lower but more compressed salary ranges, signaling limited variance in role complexity.
This distribution helps job seekers prioritize industries where strategic upskilling yields the strongest financial return.

### Remote vs. On-Site Job Patterns

Remote work availability is a crucial factor for job seekers.  
This chart shows whether industries lean toward remote, hybrid, or in-person work.

```{python}
remote_candidates = ["REMOTE_TYPE_NAME", "REMOTE_TYPE"]
remote_col = next((c for c in remote_candidates if c in df.columns), None)
```

```{python}
if remote_col:
    remote_counts = df[remote_col].value_counts().reset_index()
    remote_counts.columns = ["Work Arrangement", "Postings"]

    fig = px.pie(
        remote_counts,
        names="Work Arrangement",
        values="Postings",
        title="Remote vs On-Site Job Postings",
        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel1
    )
    fig.show()
else:
    print("No remote work field found.")
```

**Insight:**  
The majority of job postings remain in on-site formats, highlighting employers’ preference for in-person work arrangements in 2024.
Remote and hybrid roles, though smaller in share, are concentrated in data, IT, and knowledge-based fields, areas where digital workflows allow greater flexibility.
Job seekers targeting remote opportunities will benefit from focusing on tech-aligned roles.

### Job Postings Over Time

Seasonal and macroeconomic patterns show up in how postings evolve over time.
We aggregate job postings by month using the standardized POSTED date.

```{python}
if "POSTED" in df.columns:
    df["POSTED"] = pd.to_datetime(df["POSTED"], errors="coerce")

    monthly = (
        df.groupby(df["POSTED"].dt.to_period("M"))
        .size()
        .reset_index(name="Postings")
    )
    monthly["Month"] = monthly["POSTED"].astype(str)
else:
    monthly = pd.DataFrame()

if not monthly.empty:
    fig = px.line(
        monthly,
        x="Month",
        y="Postings",
        title="Monthly Job Posting Trends (2024)",
        markers=True,
        color_discrete_sequence=["#34495E"],
        height=500
    )
    fig.update_traces(line_width=3)
    fig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=45)
    fig.show()
else:
    print("No valid POSTED data to plot monthly trend.")
```

**Insight:**  
Job postings display a clear mid-year dip followed by a sharp rebound, mirroring traditional hiring slowdowns in June and accelerated recruitment in late summer.
These timing patterns provide job seekers with practical cues on when to intensify applications for better response rates.
Hiring volatility also reflects broader economic cycles and seasonal business needs.

### Geographic Distribution of Jobs (by State)

Geographic EDA answers: “Which states have the most job opportunities?”
We use STATE_NAME (cleaned) to compute the total number of postings per state.

```{python}
if "STATE_NAME" in df.columns:
    state_counts = df["STATE_NAME"].value_counts().head(25).reset_index()
    state_counts.columns = ["State", "Postings"]

    fig = px.bar(
        state_counts,
        x="Postings",
        y="State",
        orientation="h",
        title="Top 25 States by Job Postings",
        color="Postings",
        color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.Teal,
        height=700
    )
    fig.update_layout(yaxis={'categoryorder':'total ascending'})
    fig.show()
else:
    print("STATE_NAME field not found.")
```

**Insight:**  
Texas, California, and Florida emerge as national hiring hubs, driven by their diverse industries, large populations, and strong business ecosystems.
Higher-opportunity states tend to experience sustained economic growth and attract employers seeking larger talent pools.
This distribution helps job seekers target geographic markets aligned with stronger job availability.

### Top Software Skills in Job Postings

To support the Skill Gap Analysis page, we identify which software tools are requested most often.
This uses the cleaned SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME column produced in the Data Cleaning step.

```{python}
if "SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME" in df.columns:
    skills = (
        df["SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME"]
        .astype(str)
        .str.split(",")
        .explode()
        .str.strip()
    )
    skills = skills[(skills != "") & (skills != "nan")]

    top_skills = skills.value_counts().head(15).reset_index()
    top_skills.columns = ["Skill", "Postings"]

    fig = px.bar(
        top_skills,
        x="Postings",
        y="Skill",
        orientation="h",
        title="Top 15 Software Skills Requested",
        color="Postings",
        color_continuous_scale=px.colors.sequential.OrRd,
        height=600
    )
    fig.update_layout(yaxis={'categoryorder':'total ascending'})
    fig.show()
else:
    print("Software skills column not available.")
```

**Insight:**
SQL, Python, and Excel remain foundational tools across business and analytical roles, making them priority competencies for job seekers.
Demand for Tableau, Power BI, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure) confirms employers’ shift toward data-driven decision making and scalable cloud ecosystems.
These skill patterns guide students in prioritizing certifications and upskilling paths.
