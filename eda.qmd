## EDA Overview

This page explores job demand, salary distributions, geographic variation, and remote work patterns using the cleaned Lightcast dataset.  
Each visualization includes an explanation of why it was chosen and what insights it provides, aligning with the project rubric.

## Job Postings by Industry

Understanding industry-level hiring patterns helps identify which sectors create the most opportunities for job seekers.  
This also provides context for later skill analysis and modeling.

```{python}
import plotly.express as px
import pandas as pd

lightcast_jp = pd.read_csv("data/lightcast_job_postings.csv", low_memory=False)

if "INDUSTRY_NAME" in lightcast_jp.columns:
    industry_counts = (
        lightcast_jp["INDUSTRY_NAME"]
        .value_counts()
        .reset_index()
        .rename(columns={"index": "Industry", "INDUSTRY_NAME": "Postings"})
    )

    fig = px.bar(
        industry_counts,
        x="Industry",
        y="Postings",
        title="Job Postings by Industry",
        color="Postings",
        color_continuous_scale="Blues"
    )
    fig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45)
    fig
```

**Insight:**  
Industries with the highest job posting volume typically reflect strong hiring demand and labor shortages, making them attractive for new graduates and career changers.

</div>

<div class="card reveal">

## Salary Distribution by Industry

Salary variation across industries provides insight into compensation inequality and which fields reward skills more strongly.

```{python}
if {"INDUSTRY_NAME", "SALARY_FROM"}.issubset(lightcast_jp.columns):
    fig = px.box(
        lightcast_jp,
        x="INDUSTRY_NAME",
        y="SALARY_FROM",
        title="Salary Distribution by Industry",
        color="INDUSTRY_NAME"
    )
    fig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45, showlegend=False)
    fig
```

**Insight:**  
Boxplots reveal which industries pay consistently higher wages, and which have wider salary ranges — often associated with specialized roles or greater inequality in pay structures.

</div>

## Remote vs. On-Site Job Patterns

Remote work availability is a crucial factor for job seekers.  
This chart shows whether industries lean toward remote, hybrid, or in-person work.

```{python}
if "REMOTE_TYPE_NAME" in lightcast_jp.columns:
    fig = px.pie(
        lightcast_jp,
        names="REMOTE_TYPE_NAME",
        title="Remote vs. On-Site Jobs",
        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Set2
    )
    fig
```

**Insight:**  
Higher proportions of remote roles typically appear in tech, analytics, and consulting jobs — reflecting digital transformation and post-pandemic workforce changes.

## Job Postings Over Time (Optional but Recommended)

If the Lightcast dataset includes posting dates, this visualization helps identify hiring cycles.

```{python}
if "POSTED" in lightcast_jp.columns:
    lightcast_jp["POSTED"] = pd.to_datetime(lightcast_jp["POSTED"], errors="coerce")
    monthly_counts = (
        lightcast_jp
        .groupby(lightcast_jp["POSTED"].dt.to_period("M"))
        .size()
        .reset_index(name="Postings")
    )
    monthly_counts["POSTED"] = monthly_counts["POSTED"].astype(str)

    fig = px.line(
        monthly_counts,
        x="POSTED",
        y="Postings",
        title="Job Postings Over Time",
    )
    fig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45)
    fig
```

**Insight:**  
Patterns across months reveal seasonal hiring surges — typically early-year recruitment and late-year budget cycle hiring.

## Top Software Skills in Job Postings (Optional but Highly Valuable)

This adds depth to your skill gap analysis by revealing what employers request most frequently.

```{python}
if "SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME" in lightcast_jp.columns:
    import re

    df_skills = (
        lightcast_jp["SOFTWARE_SKILLS_NAME"]
        .fillna("")
        .str.replace("\n", "")
        .apply(lambda x: re.findall(r'"(.*?)"', x))
        .explode()
    )

    skill_counts = df_skills.value_counts().head(15)

    fig = px.bar(
        skill_counts,
        x=skill_counts.values,
        y=skill_counts.index,
        orientation="h",
        title="Top Software Skills Requested (Top 15)",
        color=skill_counts.values,
        color_continuous_scale="Blues"
    )
    fig.update_layout(yaxis_title="Skill", xaxis_title="Frequency")
    fig
```

**Insight:**  
This highlights which tools and technologies job seekers must prioritize to stay competitive — commonly SQL, Python, AWS, Tableau, or Excel.
