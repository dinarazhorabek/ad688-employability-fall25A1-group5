## Practical Applications

To convert our job market analytics into actionable career recommendations, we followed a structured three-step framework:

### **1. Market Demand Extraction**
We analyzed Lightcast job postings for Data & Analytics roles across high-demand sectors (Information, Finance & Insurance, and Professional Services).  

### **2. Team Capability Assessment**
Each member evaluated their skill levels (1–5) across seven core analytics competencies.  

### **3. Gap & Alignment Strategy**
By comparing industry demand vs. team proficiency, we identified skill strengths, shortages, and role-alignment recommendations.
