Our model explains approximately 24.3% of the variation in advertised salaries.

The results show a downward trend in salary as industries become more female-dominated, even after controlling for experience, employment type, remote status, staffing firm involvement, and state-level differences. In other words, job postings in male-dominated industries are associated with higher advertised salaries, while female-dominated sectors tend to offer lower salaries for otherwise comparable postings in our dataset.\n\n\nCode\nbase = X_train.mean().copy()\n\npred = {}\nfor group_code in [0, 1, 2]:\n    base[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE\"] = group_code\n    pred[group_code] = model.predict(base.to_frame().T)[0]\n\nmerged = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE\": list(pred.keys()),\n    \"PREDICTED_SALARY\": list(pred.values())\n})\nmerged[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE\"] = merged[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE\"].map(\n    {v: k for k, v in gender_encoding.items()}\n    )    \nmerged = merged[[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE\", \"PREDICTED_SALARY\"]]\nprint(merged)\n\n\n   GENDER_DOMINANCE  PREDICTED_SALARY\n0    Male-dominated     123564.708984\n1             Mixed     116566.035994\n2  Female-dominated     109567.363003"

    "title": "Gender Disparities in Hiring & Political Influence",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe following section provides a research-based overview of gender disparities in hiring and leadership across academic, organizational, and political contexts. These insights serve as the conceptual foundation for our broader job-market analysis, helping us connect large-scale labor trends with the social and structural dynamics that influence real hiring outcomes. Without altering the original findings, this introduction contextualizes why an understanding of gendered patterns remains crucial for interpreting hiring behaviors and market inequalities in 2024.\n\n\nGender disparity in academic positions and STEM discipline\nGender disparities go beyond who holds positions of power, raising deeper questions about the value and compensation assigned to women’s work. In academic STEM disciplines, these pay inequalities occur alongside ongoing underrepresentation, which becomes more pronounced at senior levels. According to the research conducted by (Danielle J. Galvin ,Susan C. Anderson ,Chelsi J. Marolf ,Nikole G. Schneider ,Andrea L. Liebl (2024)), of over 20,000 faculty positions across 127 universities revealed that while women constitute approximately 50% of assistant professors in STEM fields, their representation declines significantly to 45.4% at the associate level and just 32.8% among full professors. Geographic variations are noticeable: though the Pacific and East North Central regions show the highest levels of gender representation, yet women in these areas account for only about 25% of tenure-track positions. Whereas mountain region showed visibly lower levels at just 19%. These regional differences seem to reflect the influence of state-level policies such as equal pay laws and paid family leave, as well as local cultural norms and institutional support systems.\nThese inequality patterns closely tied to the “leaky pipeline” effect, whereas women are more likely to leave STEM careers over time as barriers and disadvantages accumulate throughout their career path. When women are hired into STEM positions, they often receive smaller initial packages than male colleagues, placing them at an immediate disadvantage in launching their researches. Once employed, women often take on a heavier load of mentoring and service work without extra pay, tedious and repetitive tasks that are frequently overlooked in tenure evaluations. This imbalance may persist because women are often viewed as “caretakers,” while men are seen as more “task-driven.” Particularly, states with stronger equal pay laws and better comprehensive family-leave policies, including California, Massachusetts, Oregon, and Washington, illustrate smaller gaps in both representation and compensation. Understanding how wage disparities intersect with structural barriers and cultural perceptions is essential for addressing why qualified women continue to face obstacles in attaining leadership roles and receive recognition that matches their contributions.\n\n\nGender stereotypes in organizational structure\nHiring women into top leadership roles, like CEOs or board members, can change the way organizations talk about women (Lawson et al. (2022)). By analyzing over 43,000 company documents with advanced language tools, the researchers found that when women are appointed to senior positions, the language used by those organizations starts to describe women with more leadership-related traits such as confidence and decisiveness. Importantly, this shift doesn’t reduce how often women are described as kind or caring, it simply expands how they are portrayed. In other words, bringing women into leadership helps reshape how society links “being a woman” with “being a leader.”\nThe research is based on the idea that women’s underrepresentation in leadership comes partly from language and stereotypes that associate men with power and women with warmth. Previous solutions like diversity training often have short-term results. This study suggests that a more lasting change can happen through representation itself: when women hold visible positions of power, they naturally help transform the language, attitudes, and stereotypes that have limited them in the first place.\n\n\nSpecific case: A newly selected Female Prime Minister in Japan\nAlthough gender representation in leadership has improved in recent decades, perceptions of authority often remain unequal. Research consistently shows that women and men can perform equally well as leaders, yet they are judged differently because of deeply rooted social expectations. (Eagly and Karau (2002))’s role congruity theory suggests that society continues to associate effective leadership with traits that are traditionally viewed as masculine, such as assertiveness, decisiveness, and authority. As a result, when women display these same qualities, they are often perceived as competent but less likable or overly dominant. A recent experiment published in (Schneider, Altmann, and Langen (2023)) also found that identical leadership decisions were rated as more legitimate when made by men than by women, even after controlling for all other variables. Taken together, these findings highlight a subtle yet persistent perception gap in which authority remains unconsciously linked to gendered expectations. This perception gap helps explain why women, despite achieving comparable results, still encounter skepticism and resistance in positions of power.\nThis bias is not confined to the workplace but extends into politics and global governance. In 2025, Japan elected Sanae Takaichi as its first female prime minister, marking a historic moment for a country that has long struggled with gender equality in leadership. As reported by (TIME Magazine (2025)), public and media reactions reflected both celebration and hesitation, combining admiration for this milestone with ongoing scrutiny of her leadership style and decision-making approach. Commentators frequently described her potential leadership through gendered narratives, questioning whether she would govern with “feminine sensitivity” or “masculine toughness,” expressions rarely used to evaluate male leaders. This reaction illustrates how even moments of progress can be accompanied by persistent stereotypes that frame women’s authority through outdated cultural norms. Ultimately, addressing this issue requires more than improving access to leadership opportunities; it calls for a broader cultural shift in how societies define and value leadership, recognizing competence, vision, and authority as qualities that transcend gender.\n\n\nConclusion\nTogether, these three perspectives highlight how gender disparities emerge and persist across multiple domains of public life. They demonstrate that inequality is reinforced not only by structural and economic barriers but also by cultural narratives and expectations that shape how leaders are perceived. This research background provides the conceptual framing that informs our later analysis of job-market data, helping us connect macro-level labor trends with the deeper social patterns that influence hiring, advancement, and representation in 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nDanielle J.

Our goal is to understand how economic conditions, skill demand, and organizational behavior shape opportunities for job seekers entering the market in 2024.\nThe analysis integrates quantitative data (job postings, salaries, geographic distribution, required skills) with qualitative insights drawn from peer-reviewed literature on hiring dynamics, gender disparities, and political context. By combining these perspectives, we provide a more holistic and actionable understanding of labor-market patterns.\n\n\nData Sources\nOur project leverages two primary sources:\n\nLightcast Job Postings (2024)\nThis dataset includes thousands of job postings across the United States, containing information on:\n\njob titles\n\nemployer details\n\nrequired skills\n\nsalaries where reported\n\ngeographic location\n\nposting dates\n\nAfter cleaning and standardization, this dataset serves as the backbone of our empirical analysis, allowing exploration of hiring demand, wage patterns, and regional variations.\n\n\nFRED Macroeconomic Indicators\nTo contextualize shifts in hiring, we incorporate macroeconomic time series from the Federal Reserve, including:\n\nunemployment rates\n\nlabor-force participation\n\nCPI and inflation measures\n\nsector-level economic activity\n\nThese indicators help clarify why specific industries expand or contract over time.\n\n\n\nWhy It Matters\nNavigating the job market has become increasingly complex for recent graduates and career-switchers. Economic uncertainty, rapid technological development, and evolving skill requirements mean that job seekers must adapt to conditions that shift year to year.\nThree guiding questions shape our analysis:\n\nWhich skills are most in demand in 2024, and how have they evolved?\n\nHow do geographic and sectoral differences influence job opportunities and salary outcomes?\n\nHow do broader social factors, such as gender representation and organizational culture affect hiring?\n\nThese questions connect quantitative job-posting data with research on labor inequality, organizational behavior, and workforce development.\n\n\nWebsite Structure\nThis website synthesizes findings across several analytical components:\n\nResearch Background\nAcademic perspectives on gender disparities, labor dynamics, and political influences.\nAnalysis\n\nGender Dispartities Overview :\nData Cleaning & Preparation : Standardizing, restructuring, and validating Lightcast job postings.\nExploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Hiring patterns, salary distributions, geographic variation, and skills demand.\nGender Dominance in Job Postings :\nMachine Learning Models : Clustering and predictive modeling of job-market patterns.\nNLP Analysis : Extracting insights from job descriptions, including skills and thematic patterns.\nSkill Gap Analysis : Comparison between team skill sets and market expectations.\n\nCareer Strategy\nAbout Us\n\nCollectively, these analyses provide a comprehensive, data-driven picture of the 2024 job market and inform actionable career strategies."

However, job availability varies widely across some high-paying sectors: Information with a comparatively modest 2166 postings, while Professional/Scientific/Technical Services offers both high pay and large availability of 8530 postings. Thus, hands-on, strongly male-dominated fields like construction, mining, and agriculture show noticeably lower median salaries compared to many other industries overall, highlighting that physically intensive sectors don’t necessarily correspond to higher earnings.\n\n\nChart 5: Median Salary and Job Count Across Female-Dominated Industries\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for female-dominated industries\nfemale_df = df_salary[df_salary[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE\"] == \"Female-dominated\"]\n\n# Compute industry-level median salary\nfemale_salary_summary = (\n    female_df.groupby(\"NAICS2_NAME\")[\"SALARY\"]\n    .median()\n    .sort_values(ascending=False)\n)\n\n# Compute industry-level job counts\nfemale_job_counts = (female_df.groupby(\"NAICS2_NAME\")[\"SALARY\"]\n    .count()\n    .reindex(female_salary_summary.index))\n\n# Pastel pink for bars\npastel_pink = \"rgba(255, 179, 207, 0.8)\"\nfig_female = go.Figure()\nfig_female.add_trace(\n    go.Bar(\n        x=female_salary_summary.index,\n        y=female_salary_summary.values,\n        text=[\n            f\"${v:,.0f}\" for v in female_salary_summary.values\n            ],\n        textposition=\"outside\",\n        marker_color=pastel_pink,\n        name=\"Median Salary\"\n    )\n)\n\n# Add trend line for female-dominated industry job counts\nfig_female.add_trace(\n    go.Scatter(\n        x=female_salary_summary.index,\n        y=female_job_counts.values,\n        mode=\"lines+markers\",\n        name=\"Job Count\",\n        yaxis=\"y2\"\n    )\n)\n\nfig_female.update_layout(\n    title=\"Median Salary and Job Count Across Female-Dominated Industries\",\n    xaxis_title=\"Industry\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Median Salary\",\n    yaxis2=dict(\n        title=\"Job Count\",\n        overlaying=\"y\",\n        side=\"right\",\n    ),\n    xaxis_tickangle=40,\n    # width=1100,\n    height=700,\n    margin=dict(l=50, r=70, t=80, b=150),\n    legend=dict(\n        orientation=\"h\", \n        yanchor=\"bottom\", \n        y=1.02, \n        xanchor=\"right\", \n        x=1)\n)\nfig_female.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nFemale-dominated industries show a wider salary spread, ranging from about $76k to $145k, with Accommodation and Food Services unexpectedly offering the highest median pay ($144,560) despite only 212 job counts.

    "text": "Improvement Plan\n\nHow can the team collaborate to bridge skill gaps?\n\nWhile our team demonstrates strong proficiency across most software skills, we still need more consistency to meet industry expectations. To address this, we developed a collaborative improvement plan where members with higher expertise will guide others through structured peer learning. The plan focuses on small but consistent practice activities, especially in the skills with the highest industry demand: Python, SQL, Tableau/Power BI, and Microsoft Excel. For example, we will practice SQL by solving LeetCode problems and joining SQL contests, and strengthen Power BI and Tableau skills by creating hands-on visualizations. We will also remain active on GitHub to document progress and maintain a strong professional portfolio."

These sectors typically exhibit continuous hiring cycles driven by project-based work, business expansion, and comparatively high turnover. For job seekers, they represent strong entry points into the labor market with broad role variety and relatively frequent openings.\n\n\n\nAnnual Salary - Trend Over Time\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n\ndf2 = df.copy()\ndf2 = df2.dropna(subset=[\"ANNUAL_SALARY\", \"month\"])\n\n# Group by month (string)\nagg = (\n    df2.groupby(\"month\")\n    .agg(\n        postings=(\"ANNUAL_SALARY\", \"size\"), \n        avg_salary=(\"ANNUAL_SALARY\", \"mean\")\n        ).reset_index().sort_values(\"month\")\n)\n\n# Dual-axis chart\n# fig = make_subplots(specs=[[{\"secondary_y\": True}]])\nfig = go.Figure()\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(\n    x=agg[\"month\"],\n    y=agg[\"postings\"],\n    name=\"Job Postings\",\n    marker_color=\"#ff7043\",\n    yaxis=\"y1\",\n    hovertemplate=\"Job postings: %{y:,}&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;\"\n))\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=agg[\"month\"],\n    y=agg[\"avg_salary\"],\n    name=\"Annual Salary\",\n    mode=\"lines+markers\",\n    yaxis=\"y2\",\n    line=dict(color=\"#1f77b4\", width=3),\n    hovertemplate=\"Salary: $%{y:,.0f}&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;\"\n))\n\nfig.update_layout(\n    title=\"Annual Salary - Trend Over Time\",\n    template=\"plotly_white\",\n    hovermode=\"x unified\",\n    legend=dict(\n        orientation=\"h\", \n        yanchor=\"bottom\", \n        y=1.02, \n        xanchor=\"right\", \n        x=1),\n    xaxis=dict(\n        title=\"Month\",\n        tickformat=\"%b %Y\",\n        showgrid=True,\n        gridcolor=\"#eaeaea\"\n    ),\n    yaxis=dict(\n        title=\"Job Postings\",\n        showgrid=True,\n        gridcolor=\"#eaeaea\"\n    ),\n    yaxis2=dict(\n        title=\"Annual Salary($)\",\n        overlaying=\"y\",\n        side=\"right\",\n        tickprefix=\"$\",\n        showgrid=False\n    )\n)\nfig.show()\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nInsight:\n\n\nSalary Distribution by Industry\nSalary variation across industries answers: “Which sectors pay more, and how unequal are wages within each industry?” We use the annualized salary field (ANNUAL_SALARY), which consolidates raw salary data from SALARY_FROM, SALARY_TO, and SALARY and converts it into a consistent yearly format based on reported pay period. This provides a clean, comparable measure of compensation across all industries.\n\n\nCode\nindustry_col = industry_col\nsalary_col = \"ANNUAL_SALARY\" if \"ANNUAL_SALARY\" in df.columns else None\n\nif industry_col and salary_col:\n\n    # Filter valid salaries\n    df_salary = df[[industry_col, salary_col]].dropna()\n\n    # Remove noise categories that distort analysis\n    df_salary = df_salary[df_salary[industry_col] != \"Unclassified Industry\"]\n\n    # Cap extreme values at 300k for readability (still accurate for 95% of postings)\n    df_salary[salary_col] = np.where(df_salary[salary_col] &gt; 300000, 300000, df_salary[salary_col])\n\n    # Compute median salary per industry for ordering\n    medians = (\n        df_salary.groupby(industry_col)[salary_col]\n        .median()\n        .sort_values(ascending=True)\n    )\n\n    ordered_categories = medians.index.tolist()\n\n    fig = px.box(\n        df_salary,\n        y=industry_col,\n        x=salary_col,\n        category_orders={industry_col: ordered_categories},\n        title=\"Annual Salary Distribution by Industry\",\n        color=industry_col,\n        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Vivid,\n        height=900\n    )\n\n    fig.update_layout(\n        showlegend=False,\n        xaxis_title=\"Annual Salary (USD)\",\n        yaxis_title=\"Industry\",\n        margin=dict(l=120)\n    )\n\n    fig.show()\n\nelse:\n    print(\"Salary chart not generated: Missing industry or salary column.\")\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nInsight:\nAnnual salary levels differ substantially across industries, with Finance, Information, and Professional Services exhibiting the highest median compensation. The wide dispersion of salaries within these sectors reflects variation in seniority, specialization, and credential requirements. In contrast, service-oriented industries such as Retail and Accommodation & Food Services show lower but more compressed salary ranges, consistent with narrower variation in role complexity. These patterns suggest that targeted upskilling toward high-skill roles in Finance, Tech, and Professional Services is likely to yield the greatest earnings uplift.\n\n\nRemote vs. On-Site Job Patterns\nRemote work availability is a crucial factor for job seekers.\nThis chart shows whether industries lean toward remote, hybrid, or in-person work. Here, [None] represents postings where Lightcast did not provide a remote-work tag, which typically corresponds to on-site or unspecified arrangements.\n\n\nCode\nremote_candidates = [\"REMOTE_TYPE_NAME\", \"REMOTE_TYPE\"]\nremote_col = next((c for c in remote_candidates if c in df.columns), None)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nif remote_col:\n    remote_counts = df[remote_col].value_counts().reset_index()\n    remote_counts.columns = [\"Work Arrangement\", \"Postings\"]\n\n    fig = px.pie(\n        remote_counts,\n        names=\"Work Arrangement\",\n        values=\"Postings\",\n        title=\"Remote vs On-Site Job Postings\",\n        color_discrete_sequence=px.colors.qualitative.Pastel1\n    )\n    fig.show()\nelse:\n    print(\"No remote work field found.\")\n\n\n                            \n                                            \n\n\nInsight:\nThe majority of postings either do not explicitly tag remote work or are implicitly on-site, with only a modest share labeled as Remote or Hybrid. Where remote options are available, they are concentrated in data, IT, and knowledge-intensive roles that can be performed digitally. For job seekers prioritizing location flexibility, this suggests focusing on analytically oriented roles and employers that have formal remote-work policies rather than assuming remote options are widespread across all occupations.\n\n\nGeographic Distribution of Jobs (by State)\nGeographic EDA answers: “Which states have the most job opportunities?” We use STATE_NAME (cleaned) to compute the total number of postings per state.\n\n\nCode\nSTATE_CENTROIDS = {\n    \"AL\": (32.806, -86.791), \"AK\": (64.200, -149.493), \"AZ\": (34.049, -111.094),\n    \"AR\": (35.201, -91.832), \"CA\":

strong business ecosystems. Many of the remaining top states, such as Virginia, New York, New Jersey, and North Carolina are anchored by federal agencies, financial centers, or technology clusters. Concentrating job search efforts in these high-volume states can materially increase the number of suitable opportunities available to candidates.\n\n\nTop Software Skills in Job Postings\nTo support the Skill Gap Analysis page, we identify which software tools are requested most often.

Tableau and Power BI, together with dashboarding skills more broadly, highlight the premium placed on communicating data insights visually. Cloud and platform skills such as AWS, Azure, and Oracle Cloud are less frequent but still prominent, indicating growing demand for candidates who can work across both traditional analytics stacks and modern cloud-based architectures.\n\n\n\nEDA Summary\nThe exploratory analysis reveals five consistent themes in the 2024 job market:\n\nIndustry concentration: Hiring is heavily concentrated in Professional Services, Administrative & Support Services, and key service sectors, which together generate a large share of postings.\nCompensation differences: Median annual salaries vary sharply by industry, with Finance, Information, and Professional Services offering the strongest earnings potential.\nRemote work structure: Explicitly remote and hybrid roles remain a minority but are disproportionately found in digital and analytics-intensive occupations.\nSeasonality: Job posting activity dips around late June and rebounds sharply in late summer, highlighting the importance of timing in job search strategies.\nSkill demand: SQL, Python, Excel, BI tools, and cloud platforms dominate technical requirements, defining a clear “baseline stack” for aspiring data and business analytics professionals.\n\nThese insights directly feed into the subsequent Skill Gap Analysis, ML Methods, and Career Strategy sections by identifying which industries, skills, and time windows matter most for job seekers in 2024."

The significant spike around 2020–2022 reflects the pandemic lockdown, though, surprisingly, women seem to recover more quickly, suggesting a faster re-entry into the labor market.

As societal attitudes shifted and educational and professional opportunities expanded, women’s participation rose steadily - climbing from roughly 32% in 1950 to nearly 60% by 2000.

Since then, women’s median weekly earnings have risen steadily, from about $250 in 1980 to over $330 today, showing positive progress in workforce representation and pay equity. However, despite this catch-up, men continue to earn more on average, indicating that the earnings gap, while smaller, remains noticeable."

 \n\n\nThe 2024 map shows that several red states have some of the largest bubbles, indicating higher female employment shares, particularly Mississippi (36%), Arkansas (34%), Louisiana (32.1%), and Wyoming (31.7%). The highest-share blue area is the District of Columbia at 35.6%. Together, these values line up with the earlier observation that in 2024, the women’s share happens to be slightly higher in red states than in blue states.\n\n\nConclusion\nAcross the four-year period, blue states consistently show a slightly higher women’s share overall, but 2024 stands out with red states surpassing blue states by a narrow margin. The state-level map reinforces this shift, with several red states displaying notably high female employment shares. Taken together, these results suggest that while political alignment reflects broad trends, gender dynamics can still vary meaningfully at the state level."

Our model explains approximately 24.3% of the variation in advertised salaries. Meaning that the model captures some underlying structure—especially differences driven by experience, industry, and location—but much of the salary variation remains unexplained under a linear framework.\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score, mean_squared_error\n\ny_pred_lr = model.predict(X_test)\nlr_r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred_lr)\nlr_rmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred_lr) ** 0.5\nprint(f\"R²: {lr_r2:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"RMSE: {lr_rmse:.4f}\")\n\n\nR²: 0.2432\nRMSE: 39206.1659\n\n\nPredicted Salary by Dominance Group\nUsing the average job posting profile in our dataset, we generated predicted salaries for each gender dominance category. The results show a downward trend in salary as industries become more female-dominated, even after controlling for experience, employment type, remote status, staffing firm involvement, and state-level differences. In other words, job postings in male-dominated industries are associated with higher advertised salaries, while female-dominated sectors tend to offer lower salaries for otherwise comparable postings in our dataset.\nRather than a universal labor-market pattern, the results reflect:\n\nA salary premium associated with male-dominated technical and analytical job clusters represented in our dataset, not necessarily a generalizable pattern across the entire U.S. workforce.\n\nThis contextual caveat helps ensure the analysis is interpreted correctly without overstating conclusions beyond the scope of the available data.\n\n\nCode\nbase = X_train.mean().copy()\n\npred = {}\nfor group_code in [0, 1, 2]:\n    base[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE\"] = group_code\n    pred[group_code] = model.predict(base.to_frame().T)[0]\n\nmerged = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE\": list(pred.keys()),\n    \"PREDICTED_SALARY\": list(pred.values())\n})\nmerged[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE\"] = merged[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE_CODE\"].map(\n    {v: k for k, v in gender_encoding.items()}\n    )    \nmerged = merged[[\"GENDER_DOMINANCE\", \"PREDICTED_SALARY\"]]\nprint(merged)\n\n\n   GENDER_DOMINANCE  PREDICTED_SALARY\n0    Male-dominated     123564.708984\n1             Mixed     116566.035994\n2  Female-dominated     109567.363003"
